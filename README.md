# covid-19
Extracted from Google's Community Mobility Reports (https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/) using the Mobility Report graph extractor by ONS (https://github.com/datasciencecampus/mobility-report-data-extractor).

I'll be updating the files and adding some statistical results as they come in.  If you're interested in working together on the data, let me know at gard-murray@fas.harvard.edu.
